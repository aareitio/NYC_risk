The process

1. Business Understanding
3. Find data
2. Understand data 
  - Understand all columns
  - Run tests involving aggregate data:
        - Neighborhoods with most accidents
        - Day of the week with most accidents
        - Time of the day with most accidents
        - Type of car involved in most accidents
4. Define business rules (criteria)
  -  Criteria for dangerous routes
  -  Define a scale to measure risk
  -  Define the influence radius of an accident
5. Prepare data/matrix 
  -  Choose the columns/criteria that make more sense (dimensionality reduction)
  -  Fill missing data by combining other data 
6. Develop logic/work flow
7. Develop code
8. Test 
9. Implement solution
